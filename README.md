# What's this?

This is the source code for my wedding site. I used GitHub Pages to host the site, and it's available at [hemawedsvishal.com](hemawedsvishal.com).

# Will I find this useful? 

Not sure--it's a fairly simple, static page, which would help someone just getting started in web design.

# What did you use on this site?

The page itself was built using Bootstrap 3 and a little bit of jQuery. I attempted to use Bootstrap for as much as I could, avoiding my own custom JavaScript code wherever possible. 

# How would I host this code on my own computer? 

This code includes a Node.js based web server. To use it, install Node.js, then issue the following commands:

    npm install
    npm start
