                        <img src="/assets/hema-vishal-stairs.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded">
                        <p>Hema and Vishal met online, via a dating service. They spoke on the phone several times, and realized they had a lot in common, from their Telugu heritage to interests in music, movies, and video games–even their love for eggplant (the best vegetable ever). It was Vishal’s first season playing fantasy football, something Hema had been playing for several years.</p>
                        <p>Their first date was at Karl Strauss Brewery in San Diego, CA. What was supposed to be a lunch date lasted three hours, as the two of them talked and talked. At the end of the date, Hema invited Vishal to join her, her sister, and her brother-in-law in Ocean Beach that evening.</p>
                        <p>They had several more dates at the arcade, playing disc golf, and strolling downtown Los Angeles and Pasadena. Vishal knew he was serious about Hema, so he asked her to come meet his parents in Fremont, CA. Unsurprisingly, Hema won over the entire family with her sense of humor and her easy-going personality. Vishal knew Hema was the one for him.</p>
                        <p>On April 16th, 2016, Vishal proposed to Hema on the cliffs of La Jolla, and the rest is history.</p>
                        <h2 id="about-hema">About Hema</h2>
                        <img src="/assets/hema.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded pull-left">
                        <p>Hema was born in Burbank, IL, a suburb of Chicago. When she was 14, she moved with her family to Arcadia, CA, where she attended high school. Hema got he B.S. in Bioengineering at the University of California, San Diego. After working at engineering firm Parsons for several years, Hema decided to return to school, completing her J.D. at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
                        <p>Hema’s pastimes include anything Marvel, ranging from comic books to movies and TV shows. She’s a regular attendee of San Diego Comic-Con, where she’s made an appearance as a “Ghostbuster”. Purple and teal are her favorite colors, but not violet or magenta. Hema loves dogs, particularly her two girls, Biscuit and Brownie.</p>

                        <img src="/assets/vishal.jpg" class="img-responsive img-rounded pull-right">
                        <p>Vishal was born in Edison, NJ, but moved to the San Fransisco Bay area when he was a year old. He attended high school in Fremont, CA. Vishal got his B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Californa, San Diego, and earned his Masters studying Computer Networking at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
                        <p>Vishal’s pastimes include disc golf, video games, and lounging on the beach. Orange is his favorite color, because it’s loud and vibrant. He’s a big fan of spicy food, and he adores dogs.</p>
